Project name:
horiseon-seo-optimized-page

Project description:
This page loads a homepage for the company Horiseon - a marketing agency that offers consultation to improve SEO, social media marketing and brand building services. The aim purpose of my work on the page was to improve it's SEO standing.

The motivation from the client: As a marketing agency they want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their our own site is optimized for search engines.

To meet their expectations, I've added alt descriptions to the few images included on the page. I've also optimized the layout of the CSS elements such that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Similarly, all the heading attributes fall in sequential order. Finally, I've amended the title so it's more descriptive while remaining consise.
